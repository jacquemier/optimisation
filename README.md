# Optimisation
Simple C code optimisation examples: vectorisation, unroll loop, intrinsic ...

## How does it work ?
In these examples we compute the sum element by element of two 2D array (matrix) and store the result in a pre allocated matrix.
We test different ways to compute these sums and benchmark the number of CPU cycles by element.

## Compile same code with different level of optimisation
```bash
$prompt> ./buils.sh
```
## Run and compare results
```bash
$prompt> ./run.sh
```
